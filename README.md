# Binary_to_BCD_Decoder
Design and implementation of 8-bit binary to BCD decoder on Digilent Spartan 3 FPGA.

This is one of my first projects with FPGA design. The project is written in Verilog. The user can can an 8-bit binary input on the board with 8 switches and will receive a decimal output on the 4 seven-segment led displays.
